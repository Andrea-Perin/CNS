My exercises for the course "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" (aka, Computational NeuroScience) for the 2019-2020 academic year in UNiversit√† degli Studi di Padova.
Summary:
- Homework 1: a feed-forward neural network, implemented from scratch using only NumPy. Allows architectures with arbitrary numbers of layers. Also includes various activation functions and regularizations.
- Homework 2: a feed-forward network, written using PyTorch, for the classification of MNIST images.
- Homework 3: a recurrent neural network for natural language processing. Implements also a word2vec architecture.
- Homework 4: an auto-encoder and a variational auto-encoder, trained on MNIST.
- Homework 5: a simple reinforcement learning exercise. Written in vanilla NumPy. An agent tries to get to the goal by traversing an environment with various obstacles; a library for creating custom tracks is provided.
